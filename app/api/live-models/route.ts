// The canonical OpenRouter id for each catalog model, exact — never a substring.
//
// Substring matching looked harmless and was not. `list.find` returns the first entry that
// contains the needle, and OpenRouter serves several products whose ids contain each other:
// the needle "gpt-5.6" matched `openai/gpt-5.6-luna-pro`, so the GPT-5.6 Sol card rendered
// Luna Pro's $0.10/$0.60 in place of Sol's $5/$30. Six other lookups landed on a `-fast`,
// `-pro` or `-lite` variant the same way. None of it was visible: a wrong price looks exactly
// like a right one.
//
// So a lookup is now one exact provider id. A retired or renamed id resolves to nothing and
// the card keeps its archived price, which is the safe direction to fail in. `npm run
// report:gaps` reports both a dead lookup and a catalog model that has no lookup at all —
// this table cannot silently stop covering a model.
// The extension is required, not stylistic: `scripts/report-gaps.mjs` imports this file, and Node
// resolving app→app has no bundler to guess it. tsconfig has `allowImportingTsExtensions`.
