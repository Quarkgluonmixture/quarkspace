 * Tags that are NOT editorial, and therefore must never be typed by hand.

 * `tags` drives the filter chips and reads as decoration, so it was left as free text while every
 * field beside it grew a contract. That is exactly where the catalog's only self-contradiction
 * grew: `qwen3.7-max` carried an `open weights` tag while its `open` field said false, and the
 * dossier printed PROPRIETARY and the tag side by side, in one panel, for weeks. `check:models`
 * audits `open`; nothing could reach the tag. The audited copy was the correct one and the drifted
 * copy was the one the reader saw.
 *
 * So these two stop being copies. `open weights` is rendered from `open`, `preview` from the
 * published name, and passing either by hand throws rather than being silently dropped — a silent
 * filter would leave the stale hand-written tag sitting in the file looking authoritative.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: `vision` and `multimodal`. They are equally derivable in principle, from
 * `architecture.input_modalities` on the upstream feed, but no catalog field holds a modality
 * today, so deriving them would mean inventing the fact rather than moving it. That needs a
 * fetcher, not a rename. Everything else — `fast`, `value`, `coding`, `reasoning` — is genuinely
 * editorial positioning with no source to generate from, and stays hand-written.

  // DeepSeek shipped V4 Pro twice under one family name: a preview on 2026-04-24 and the GA on

  // Cybergym 52.7 → 83.3, so the two are not one model with a new build number, and `_doc` in
  // data/model-aliases.json records this exact accident happening once before — a preview's scores
  // published under the name of the model that replaced it, for a week.
  //
  // What identifies the model is now the STRING, not a date: `-0813` spellings resolve here and bare
  // ones are refused globally with a written reason, and two sources that do not split the releases
  // (DeepSWE, the pricing page) are carried by file-scoped entries whose evidence is a number or a
  // sentence the source prints. The reason it is not a date is in the archive self-test: LiveBench
  // publishes both spellings under its frozen release date 2026-06-25, so the obvious inversion of the
  // old measurement window would have deleted the GA's own 23 LiveBench cells with every check green.
  //
  // The preview's rows stay in the archive and out of the store — the Flash resolution, one record per
  // version in service. That is why this record's cells dropped when it flipped: they are now the GA's
  // own, not a superset. Nothing here was carried over, and in particular the 2026-04-26 model card's
  // eleven seed cells were removed rather than re-labelled.
  //
  // The four operating parameters are null on purpose and this is the honest state, not a gap to fill:
  // Artificial Analysis has not published the GA yet. It keeps one slug across a re-train — that is how
  // the Flash accident happened — so when its numbers move, the bare string is what will carry them,
  // and it must be attributed by file with the evidence written down rather than by lifting a global
  // refusal. Price is the exception because the vendor's own page names the release: peak list price
  // from batch 33, read on the day the rate card took effect.
  //
  // The name is copied, not derived. "DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813" is what DeepSeek publishes; the catalog
  // shows the family name because the record IS that release, the same shape as every other record
  // here. Do not add a date suffix — Flash proved third-party listing dates disagree with the maker's

 * broken outline and the panel looked wrong rather than sparse.
