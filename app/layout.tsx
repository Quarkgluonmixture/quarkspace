  // It is drawn for 16px, and the first attempt was not. Thickening the artwork's strokes was the
  // obvious fix and it was the wrong one: the real problem was that the mark occupied 53% of its
  // canvas, so a 16px tab spent half its pixels on a paper plate that is invisible against a light
  // tab bar. Measured in a real Chrome tab: 26/256 dark pixels, against 44/256 for the observatory
  // icon beside it. Filling the canvas — ring radius 45% → 60% of the width — puts it at 67/256.
  //
  // The crosshair ticks and the centre sparkle are gone, and that is the deliberate part. At 16px
  // they were not detail, they were four gold specks muddying the inside of the ring; a tick 24
  // units wide on a 1254 canvas renders 0.31px and no weight fixes that. What survives is what
  // still reads at 16px: the gap that makes the ring a Q, the tail, and one accent on its nib. The
  // full detailed artwork is archived under `docs/assets/icons/`.
