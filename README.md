# AI Model Observatory · AI 模型观测站

A bilingual, mobile-ready dashboard for comparing frontier AI models across versioned capability benchmarks, best-available agent systems, human-preference rankings, throughput, context windows, and token prices.

一个支持中英文切换与手机端使用的前沿 AI 模型看板，可查看排行榜、能力雷达图、多模型 Benchmark 折线对比、上下文窗口及实时 Token 价格。

**Live: [quarkspace.top/models](https://quarkspace.top/models)** — the root route of the same
deployment is the owner's personal site. Hosted on Tencent EdgeOne Pages, ICP-filed; see
[Deploy](#deploy-to-tencent-edgeone-pages).

**Persona Lab: [quarkspace.top/persona](https://quarkspace.top/persona)** — a protected Qwen-powered
workspace for compiling natural-language character prompts into several Encode Persona candidates,
selecting one, and running direct probe experiments with observable reasoning traces.

For implementation details and AI-agent handoff, read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). The repository is maintained partly by a scheduled agent; its standing instructions are [`docs/AGENT-OPERATIONS.md`](docs/AGENT-OPERATIONS.md).

## Features

- 29 frontier and open-weight model families, each with its published operating points
- Chinese / English interface with persistent language preference
- separate rankings for general capability, agent systems, coding systems, human preference, speed, and value
- selectable model dossier and three-model comparison
- evidence-backed seven-axis capability radar with explicit `Not ingested` / partial / broad coverage states
- 72-benchmark catalog spanning reasoning, science, coding, agents, professional work, multimodality, and long context
- multi-model benchmark line charts and raw-score tables by capability family
- model-capability / best-system toggle to prevent harness results being presented as pure model ability
- OpenRouter price comparison rather than a live overwrite: the card shows the archived list
  price and prints the provider's current figure beside it only where the two disagree, because
  a number arriving at runtime has no archive row behind it
- portfolio ranks published only above a coverage floor, so a model measured on two of five agent
  benchmarks reads `N/A` instead of outranking one measured on all five
- mobile layout with a labelled bottom bar, card-form ranking rows, safe-area insets, and a
  layout probe (`npm run check:mobile`) that fails on horizontal overflow
- per-observation provenance: benchmark version, source type, harness, reasoning effort, tool setting, date, and context length
- sixteen sources re-read by script (`FETCHERS` in `scripts/fetchers/index.mjs`), which is what
  gives them a daily drift check and an automatic refresh; the rest are hand-transcribed, and
  every source card prints how long ago it was last read
- a release probe that watches all eleven makers the catalog carries, and a WeChat notification
  that fires on what is new rather than on what is merely still open
- 321 catalog values audited against the archive on every run, including the context window and
  open-weights flag; whatever is unsourced is listed rather than hidden

## Data sources

**A source counts as connected only when observation rows in `data/sources/` actually came from it** — the status is measured, not declared, so a source card can never imply coverage it does not have. Every source in the registry currently clears that bar; a source that did not would show as queued and affect nothing.

### Measured and not connected

- **Stanford HELM** — evaluated on 2026-08-01 and its source card *removed* rather than left queued. HELM is fully machine-readable, but across all 18 of its projects exactly one model overlaps this catalog, and its frontier project stops about a generation short. A card would have promised an ingestion target that does not exist. The measurement is recorded in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9 — re-run it before re-adding HELM.

Benchmark observations are stored in `app/model-data.ts` as `model × benchmark × version × harness` records. The ingestion order is benchmark-native leaderboards first, vendor release material for gaps, and independent evaluations for cross-checking. A missing observation is displayed as `Not ingested`, never as a score of zero. Provider pricing is *compared*, not refreshed: `app/api/live-models/route.ts` looks up exact provider ids and the UI shows the archived list price with the provider's current figure beside it where the two disagree. A number arriving at runtime has no archive row behind it, so it never becomes a catalog number.

A cell may hold more than one observation. Terminal-Bench 2.1 reports Fable 5 at 83.8% under Claude Code and 80.4% under Terminus 2; both rows are kept, the table shows the primary and marks the alternates as `+n`. Listing a source is not coverage — only transcribed rows are. `npm run check:data` prints filled cells and the benchmark / independent / vendor split so the difference stays visible:

```text
2224 observations across 1405/2117 cells (66.4% cell coverage;
benchmark 951 / independent 1054 / vendor 219)
```

The percentage moves in both directions on purpose: adding a benchmark widens the grid, so
a batch that adds evidence *and* twelve new benchmark columns can lower the ratio while
raising every absolute count. Read the three numbers together, not the percentage alone.

Data is not hand-written. Raw leaderboard rows are archived verbatim in `data/sources/*.jsonl`,
every mapping decision lives in `data/model-aliases.json` with a written reason, and
`npm run ingest` generates the typed rows. A row whose model string has no alias is skipped
and reported rather than guessed into place. `docs/INGEST-PROMPT.md` holds the transcription
contract used to collect new rows — but check for a published data file first: LiveBench renders
client-side and looked untranscribable until it turned out the page fetches its own CSV, and
DeepSWE's board loads a JSON artifact carrying every configuration it has ever run. Epoch AI
publishes its whole benchmark hub as one CC BY ZIP that the page never mentions, and Terminal-Bench
answers an unauthenticated function call found in its client's source. Agents' Last Exam was
recorded as publishing nothing machine-readable through two hand-reads; its leaderboard calls
`/api/demo/leaderboard`, a path that appears only inside the page's own JavaScript bundle. And
GDPval-AA sits behind Artificial Analysis' Pro tier in the API while the leaderboard page is
public — so that one is read by rendering the page, and MMMU the same way. Every one of them is
scripted (`npm run fetch:sources`), which is what gives them an automatic drift check and an
automatic daily refresh. The remaining batches have neither.

Sometimes there is no data file at all and the page *is* one. Vals AI was recorded as publishing
nothing machine-readable through two passes; its boards are Astro, which server-renders each
component's props into a `props="…"` attribute, so the whole leaderboard sits in the HTML as
escaped JSON. A search for `<table>`, `fetch(` or an `/api/` path answers no on a page that
contains every row. The other half of that miss: `/benchmarks` is an index with no scores on it,
and that is the page both passes measured.

Finding a data file is not the end of it either: **the file has to be the one the page renders.** Epoch's
ZIP does publish FrontierMath, and reading it would have put a retired question set — the
2025-02-28 problems, about 1.7x lower for the same model — into a column of current scores. The
board the site actually draws comes from `/data/benchmarks.csv`, which only its client chunk names.
Same publisher, same benchmark, two versions, and nothing about the filename says which is which.

Model records are hand-authored, but their numbers are audited the same way. `npm run check:models`
fails when a catalog value contradicts the archive and reports how much of the catalog nothing
on file supports:

```text
Model provenance passed: 321/321 catalog values backed by data/sources (100%),
0 with no archive row.
```

Three checks fail on things that used to be printed and ignored: a cross-source disagreement
above 20% about one configuration, two published strings from one batch resolving into one cell,
and a frozen source whose every difference is an addition. Each has an escape hatch that costs a
written reason. The first two exist because a preview release once published its scores under the
name of the model that replaced it, in plain view of a report nobody read.

## Local development

Requires Node.js 22.13 or newer.

```bash
npm ci
npm run check:data
npm run dev:next
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Persona Lab

`/persona` uses Qwen by default. The browser sends the source prompt to this application's protected
API route; only the server talks to Alibaba Model Studio, so the Qwen API key never reaches browser
JavaScript. Set these variables for local development and for both Preview and Production in EdgeOne
Makers:

```text
QWEN_API_KEY=<Alibaba Model Studio key>
QWEN_BASE_URL=https://<workspace>.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
QWEN_MODEL=qwen3.7-flash
PERSONA_ACCESS_TOKEN=<a separate long random access token>
```

The page asks for `PERSONA_ACCESS_TOKEN` and keeps it only in `sessionStorage`. Candidate and run
history stays in that browser's `localStorage`; it is not a server-side research database. Every
target call contains exactly one system message with the selected encoding and one user probe — no
hidden persona-strengthening instruction is added. Compilation and experiments are capped per request
to control accidental spend.

Alibaba Model Studio documents the workspace-specific OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint at
<https://help.aliyun.com/en/model-studio/qwen-api-via-openai-chat-completions>. EdgeOne environment
variables are configured separately for Preview and Production; changing them affects only later
deployments: <https://pages.edgeone.ai/document/build-guide>.

The full check set, which CI also runs:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run ingest && git diff --exit-code app/observations.generated.ts
npm run check:data      # observation contract + coverage report
npm run check:models    # every catalog number vs the source archive
npm run check:prices    # a promotional price that reached the catalog
npm run build
npm run check:beian     # the ICP filing reached every prerendered route (needs the build above)
```

`npm run check:upstream` is separate: it re-reads every scripted source over the network and
diffs it cell by cell, so it runs daily rather than per commit. It fails only when a **pinned**
source moved under a frozen version; a **live** board moving is new data, and the daily job
rewrites that batch and merges it. `npm run fetch:sources` re-collects them all, `npm run
fetch:sources <id>` just one.

`npm run report:gaps` asks the opposite question — what exists that was never collected. It never
fails; the scheduled job turns its output into one self-updating issue. `AA_API_KEY` in the
environment enables the Artificial Analysis source; without it that source skips itself and
everything else still runs.

`npm run check:mobile` is also outside CI, because it drives headless Chrome against a running
build. Start one first, then probe 320 / 390 / 430px:

```bash
npm run build && PORT=3111 npm run start:next
npm run check:mobile
```

It fails on horizontal document overflow and warns on text under 9px or controls under 36px.
Layout rules and the rest of the interface contract live in [`docs/UI.md`](docs/UI.md).

Production validation (the same command EdgeOne Pages runs):

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:next
```

`npm run build` is the canonical production build for EdgeOne Pages. The old Vinext compatibility build remains available as `npm run build:sites`, but is not part of the normal deploy path.

## Deploy to Tencent EdgeOne Pages

GitHub `main` is the single source of truth. EdgeOne Pages watches the branch and deploys the Next.js application and API route directly; a second Sites deployment is not required.

EdgeOne builds from the branch **independently of GitHub Actions**, so a red CI run does not hold
back a deploy. Only `npm run build` can stop production. That means a merge to `main` publishes
whether or not the checks passed — read the CI result before merging, not after.

1. Push this repository to GitHub or Gitee.
2. In EdgeOne Makers, choose **Import Git repository**.
3. Select this repository and use Node.js 22.
4. Set the install command to `npm ci`.
5. Set the build command to `npm run build`.
6. Keep the framework preset as Next.js / automatic detection.
7. Deploy, then optionally bind a custom domain.

### The custom domain and the ICP filing

This deployment serves `quarkspace.top` and `www.quarkspace.top`; EdgeOne's own
`ai-model-observatory-lhi0hg2y.edgeone.cool` serves the same build and is the fallback to test
against when the custom domain's DNS is the thing that broke. `data/deployment.json` names the
apex, which is what activates `npm run check:deployment`.

Binding is three steps and the order matters: EdgeOne first proves ownership through a `TXT`
record at `edgeonereclaim.<domain>`, and only then issues the per-host CNAME targets that route
traffic. **Ownership verification serves no traffic** — a domain can pass it and still not resolve
at all, which is a confusing hour if you expect otherwise.

For a mainland-China acceleration region the domain must be ICP-filed, and the filing has to be
displayed: `app/site-beian.tsx` renders the **service** filing number (the `…号-1` suffix, not the
bare entity number) from the root layout, so it appears on every route. Tencent also requires the
filed apex **and** its `www` host to both serve. Full detail, including the two filing authorities,
is in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) §6 — read it before changing that component.
Without an ICP-filed domain, start with the platform preview domain or an overseas/global region.

## What maintains itself

A daily job asks three questions and gives each a different answer, because collapsing them is
how a red check becomes background noise.

| Finding | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| A number moved under a version that is supposed to be frozen | Integrity failure. The job goes red and a human decides. |
| A live board published new results | New data. The batch is rewritten, the contract runs, and it merges itself. |
| Something exists that was never collected | A collection target. It becomes one self-updating issue — and only the part somebody can act on today is counted. |

An upstream model the catalog does not carry is the clearest case of that third answer being a
*target* rather than a defect: it is counted only when it clears the coverage floor, because under
the floor nobody can add it until a source evaluates it further. The rest — models under the floor,
models with no evidence yet, and pricing tiers that must never get a record at all — are printed
inside a collapsed section that says so.

The refresh is idempotent, so a week in which nothing moved writes nothing and merges nothing.
What may merge unattended is bounded by the file set rather than by who pushed it: a change
confined to `data/sources/` and the generated store is numbers moving inside a mapping that was
reviewed when its fetcher was written, and the contract is a complete check on it. A change
reaching `app/model-data.ts` or `data/model-aliases.json` introduces a *new* mapping, which is
where every real mistake in this project has come from, and it opens a pull request instead.

One narrow exception, since 2026-09-04. Artificial Analysis re-measures speed and latency
continuously, so every re-read left a catalog record quoting last week's number and a pull request
that could not merge until somebody typed twenty values across. That is not a mapping and it is not
a judgement — the archive row was written by a script from the source minutes earlier, so the
catalog is the stale side by construction — so `scripts/reconcile-aa.mjs` writes exactly those two
fields, on records that already exist, and refuses everything else. One refusal stops the whole
write and the pull request waits for a person, which is the only thing on that path that can ask
for one.

## Notes

- Metrics from different sources are not blended into a hidden universal score.
- Arena remains a separate human-preference signal rather than a capability axis.
- Raw benchmark values, versions, evaluation object, and scoring method remain visible.
- Missing source values remain `N/A`; zero is reserved for a real published score of zero. The radar never zero-fills or estimates a missing axis.
- Coverage is evidence completeness, not model quality: `Not ingested` means no compatible public observation has been loaded yet.
- Agentic results can depend on the model snapshot, harness, tools, reasoning effort, budget, and number of attempts.
- Upstream leaderboards and provider pricing change over time, so dated snapshots should be refreshed deliberately.
