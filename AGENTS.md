# AI Model Observatory — Agent Handoff

**Picking this up cold? Read `CHECKPOINT.md` first** — one page: where things stand, which
scheduler runs what and when, the commands, and what to watch. Then `TODO.md` for what is next.
`LOG.md` is append-only history and answers "why is it like this" — read it with `grep`, not
front to back. Those three carry the *state*; the files below carry the *rules*, and the rules
still come first before you change anything.

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before making structural or data changes.

**If you are an agent running on a schedule, read `docs/AGENT-OPERATIONS.md` as well.** It says
what may be done unsupervised, what must be handed back for approval, and the five mistakes that
have already been made here — all of which passed every automated check.

## Three products share this repo

- **The owner's recruiter-facing personal site spans `/`, `/resume`, and `/showcase`.**
  `/` is the main portfolio; `/resume` is the bilingual printable CV surface; `/showcase`
  is the bilingual research-poster/showcase evidence surface. Their implementation lives in
  `app/page.tsx`, `app/resume/`, `app/showcase/`, `app/home-content.ts`,
  `app/home.module.css`, `app/home-v2.module.css`, `data/career-public.json` and
  `public/shots/`. Career facts and positioning remain *upstream* in the private Career OS /
  `JobFinder`; this repository stores only a **public-safe projection** in `data/career-public.json`.
  That manifest is the recruiter-facing content authority and carries a `careerEpoch` +
  `verifiedAt`; `home-content.ts` is only its typed implementation boundary. Do not hand-copy
  volatile career facts back into JSX or re-create a second truth layer on `/resume` or
  `/showcase`. `npm run check:career` rejects known stale claims, missing stable ids and broken
  recruiter-facing route contracts. `../quark-space` remains a frozen design archive and must
  never be synced back over the current manifest.
- **`/models` is the observatory** — `app/models/page.tsx` (+ `app/models/layout.tsx` for its
  title, since the page is a client component). Everything else in this file is about the
  observatory.
- **`/persona` is Persona Lab** — `app/persona/` owns its client UI, protocol types, validation,
  activation heuristics, and scoped CSS module; `app/api/persona/` owns the protected Qwen
  compiler and probe routes. It reads no observatory data and must not put styles in
  `app/globals.css`. Its server-side Qwen key and access token come only from environment
  variables; neither may reach browser storage, API responses, or Git.
- The personal site touches **no Observatory data file**: not `data/sources/`, not
  `observations.generated.ts`, not `model-data.ts`. Its one data file is the isolated
  `data/career-public.json` manifest. A homepage content change requires `check:career`,
  `lint` and `build`; it does not require changing Observatory data.
- It must never put styles in `app/globals.css`. That file owns the observatory's phone
  contract (type floor, tap targets, safe areas — `docs/UI.md`). The personal site is scoped
  under `.home` in its own CSS module with `--h-*` prefixed properties, because globals.css
  styles bare elements (`header`, `h1`) and hangs `--ink` / `--sans` / `--mono` on `body`.
- ⚠ Do **not** copy volatile Observatory counts onto the personal homepage. The homepage should
  link to `/models` and describe the stable provenance contract instead. Exact model / benchmark /
  observation counts belong to the live product that derives them. This rule exists because copied
  counts drifted repeatedly while the Observatory kept updating correctly.
- ⚠ **The coupling runs the other way too.** The daily refresh in `.github/workflows/upstream.yml`
  runs `npm run build` before it will commit or open a pull request, and that build now includes
  the personal site. A type error in `app/page.tsx` therefore blocks the data refresh — nothing
  reaches `main`, and no PR is opened either. Failing closed is right, but know the direction:
  the portfolio can stop the pipeline. Send personal-site changes through a pull request and read
  CI before merging; EdgeOne publishes on merge regardless of what CI said.
- `scripts/check-mobile.mjs` defaults to `/models` for this reason — pointed at another route it
  would pass while a phone regression sat one route over. CI explicitly probes `/models`, `/`,
  `/resume`, and `/showcase` at 320 / 390 / 430; pass a URL manually for `/persona` or any new route.

**And one thing belongs to neither site.** `app/site-beian.tsx` (+ its CSS module) renders the ICP
filing number, and `app/layout.tsx` renders it after `{children}` so it lands on **every web route**.
Four rules on it, all of them the kind that fail silently:

- **Do not move it into a page.** A per-page footer misses the next route somebody adds, and a
  missing filing is a regulatory problem, not a display problem.
- **Do not delete or reword the number**, and do not swap the service number (`…号-1`) for the bare
  entity number. If a filing changes, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §6 says which is which.
- **Its colours are literal, deliberately.** It renders above both palettes, and inside `.home` the
  globals.css variables are still in scope, so reading a route palette can paint it wrong on
  another surface. Its bottom clearance for the phone rail rides on `:global(.shell) ~ .strip`.
- **Print is the one deliberate presentation exception.** `/resume` is a print-to-PDF surface, so
  `app/site-beian.module.css` hides only the filing strip under `@media print`; the web filing
  must remain in the DOM and visible on screen. After changing root layout, filing CSS, resume
  print styles or print controls, run `npm run check:resume-print`.

## Mission

Maintain a bilingual, mobile-first AI model observatory with honest evidence semantics. The
dashboard must separate model capability, best-system performance, human preference, speed
and price rather than hiding them inside one universal score.

The metric that matters is **cell coverage** — filled `model × benchmark` cells and the
benchmark / independent / vendor split. Adding a source card to the README moves neither.
`npm run check:data` prints both on every run.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Missing benchmark evidence is `N/A` / `Not ingested`, never numeric zero.
2. Every score originates from an observation row carrying source, version, date, harness,
   reasoning effort and tool setting where known.
3. Source precedence: benchmark-native leaderboard > independent evaluator > vendor release
   material. Vendor tables may fill gaps but never become the standard.
4. Never merge incompatible benchmark versions, context lengths, tool settings or harnesses.
5. Arena Elo is human preference, not task accuracy. Keep it out of capability tables.
6. System benchmarks reflect model + scaffold + tools + budget. Keep model and best-system
   views distinct.
7. **One catalog record per model family.** Reasoning effort belongs on the observation row
   and in `configurations`, never in a model id. See "Model identity" below.
8. **Never guess an attribution.** A row whose model string has no alias is skipped and
   reported. That is the intended outcome, not a failure to paper over.
9. Preserve Chinese/English UI parity and mobile behaviour. The phone contract — type floor, tap
   targets, scrollers, safe areas — is in `docs/UI.md`; read it before touching `app/globals.css`.
10. A portfolio average is only published above the coverage floor: half of that axis's core
    benchmarks, minimum two. Thin evidence reads `N/A`, it does not rank.
11. GitHub `main` is the source of truth, EdgeOne Pages is the production host. Do not create
    a second production deployment unless asked.

## Required checks

```bash
npm ci
npm run ingest        # rebuilds app/observations.generated.ts from data/sources/
npm run lint
npm run check:career  # recruiter-facing public manifest / stale-claim contract
npm run check:data    # observation contract + coverage report
npm run check:models  # every catalog number vs the source archive
npm run check:prices  # a promotional price that reached the catalog
npm run build
npm run check:beian   # the ICP filing reached every prerendered web route — needs the build above
npm run test:sites    # bounded Sites build + artifact validation; needs GNU timeout
```

⚠ `test:sites` exits **69** where GNU `timeout` is absent (macOS ships none). That is "could not
run", not "passed" — CI is Linux and runs it for real, so do not read a local 69 as green.

`npm run check:upstream` re-reads every scripted source and diffs it cell by cell. It needs the
network, so it runs daily rather than on every PR — see `.github/workflows/upstream.yml`. It
fails only when an **already-published number** moved under a frozen version; a **live** board
moving, and an **append-only** board gaining a row it never had, are both new data, and the same
daily workflow rewrites that batch and opens a pull request instead.

`npm run report:gaps` asks the opposite question: what exists that was never collected. Models one
cell below a ranking floor, archived rows still waiting on a catalog model, and models published
in a namespace the catalog already tracks. **It never fails** — an uncollected model is not a
defect in your commit — so it prints a report and the scheduled job turns it into one self-updating
issue. Run it before deciding what to collect next; `--no-network` skips the upstream section.

`npm run check:mobile` probes the built site at 320 / 390 / 430px under real device emulation and
fails on horizontal overflow. **It runs in CI since 2026-08-07** and now covers the four public
routes `/models`, `/`, `/resume`, and `/showcase`, so a phone
regression now fails a pull request instead of waiting for somebody to remember. Run it locally too
after a layout change — it needs Chrome and `PORT=3111 npm run start:next` — and never judge mobile
from a headless screenshot taken without emulation, which ignores the viewport meta tag and invents
overflow. The CI step refuses to skip itself: if no Chrome is found on the runner it fails the job,
because a layout check that silently passes because it never ran is worse than no layout check.

`/resume` has one additional browser contract: after the mobile probes, CI runs
`npm run check:resume-print -- http://localhost:3111/resume` under real Chrome print media.
It requires the resume paper to remain present while the screen toolbar, ICP filing and all
interactive buttons disappear. PR #143 added this after the first printable route exposed the
difference between “screen looks right” and “saved PDF is clean.”

**Stop that server when you are done.** Nothing here stops it for you, and it holds `node_modules`.
One left running on 2026-08-01 was still holding the directory four days later, where it surfaced
as an `npm ci` failure on a different machine's first run — packages on disk, `.bin` shims never
linked, so every `node` script passed and `lint` and `build` reported `not found`.

CI runs all of these, and additionally fails if `app/observations.generated.ts` differs from
a fresh `npm run ingest` — the generated file must never be hand-edited.

**Two classifiers are also replayed on every commit** (added 2026-08-10, neither needs a network or
a key):

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/lib/upstream-evidence.mjs --self-test   # sameFamily + evidence counter
node scripts/aa-new-models.mjs --self-test                                      # pricing tier vs model
```

They decide, unattended, which archived rows count as a model's evidence and which upstream names are
models at all — and `scripts/add-model-and-merge.sh` merges a new catalog record on the first of
those numbers. Both were print-only commands until a comment quoting "89% recovery, 0 over-counts"
was found still saying that weeks after the real figures had moved to 70% and 1. If you change a
matching rule, expect these to fail first; that is what they are for. The evidence counter carries
one **pinned** over-count with a written reason — a new one fails, that one does not.

Three of the contract's failures exist because a *report* was not enough. `check:data` printed
`deepseek-v4-flash/critpt: 7.14 vs 16.57` every day for a week while the live site showed a
preview release's Arena score under the name of the model that replaced it. A line that never
fails is a line nobody reads, so:

- **A cross-source disagreement above 20% now fails.** Genuine ones are allowed, but they must be
  written down in `acknowledgedDisagreements` with a reason. Most are not genuine: they are two
  models sharing a cell.
- **Two strings from one batch resolving to one cell now fails.** A source publishing two entries
  is that source saying they are two models. Exempt via `mergedInOneSource`, with a reason. This
  caught a bad alias within minutes of being written, and it catches the case the disagreement
  gate cannot — two models whose scores happen to agree.
- **A frozen source whose every difference is an addition** is now reported as a `versioning`
  declaration error rather than as rewritten history, which is what it actually is.

`npm run describe-change` says what a diff does to the published board — which model gained which
cells, which existing numbers moved. It goes at the top of every automated pull request and into
the WeChat notification, because "Qwen3.8 Max gained 12 cells: GPQA 92.6" is something a reader can
check and `batch-19-gdpval.jsonl | 175 +++` is not.

## Model identity

An id like `gpt-5.6-terra-max` cannot receive a leaderboard line that says only
`GPT-5.6 Terra` without someone guessing which effort was meant. So the catalog holds one
record per family, and each record carries `configurations` — the published operating points,
strongest first. Top-level `intelligence` / `speed` / `price` are derived from
`configurations[0]` so rankings read one number per model.

This is not cosmetic: collapsing 22 effort-specific records into 17 families raised ingestion
from 179 to 214 rows on an unchanged archive.

## Adding benchmark data

Never hand-write a score into `app/model-data.ts`.

1. Append the raw rows verbatim to `data/sources/batch-NN-*.jsonl`, plus a sibling
   `.meta.json` recording `retrievedDate` and whether the batch was filtered at capture.
2. Record the mapping decision in `data/model-aliases.json`, each with a written reason.
3. `npm run ingest`, then the rest of the checks.

`docs/INGEST-PROMPT.md` is the transcription contract to hand a browsing model. It is written
to be pasted whole, one batch at a time.

**Check for a data file before hiring a transcriber, and check the page's own JavaScript.** Batch
18 found ALE's endpoint at `/api/demo/leaderboard` — 689 rows where two hand-reads had produced 19
— and that path exists nowhere except the leaderboard's client chunk. `/api/leaderboard` and
`/data/leaderboard.json` are both 404, which is exactly how batch 03 concluded the board "publishes
nothing machine-readable". Grep the chunk for `fetch(` before believing a source is untranscribable.

Batch 05 recorded LiveBench as
UNAVAILABLE because the page renders client-side — but the page fetches its own CSV and JSON.
DeepSWE was transcribed by eye into 18 rounded rows while the page was loading a JSON artifact
with all 50 configurations at full precision. A scripted batch beats a transcribed one on every
axis that matters here: no row limit, no transcription error, re-running it *is* the drift check,
and a live board can then refresh itself into a pull request. A leaderboard that "cannot be
scraped" is often a leaderboard whose data file nobody looked for.

**But do not go looking blind, and do not stop at the landing page.** Every source was probed
twice on 2026-08-01 and the verdicts are in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9. The first pass only searched
each page's HTML and missed the two biggest wins in the archive: Epoch AI publishes its entire
benchmark hub as a ZIP the page never links, and Terminal-Bench answers a function call that only
appears in its client's source. **Where the data lives is not always where the page is.**

Three failure modes that pass a naive check, all hit for real:
- **A live 200 with plausible JSON is not verification.** Hugging Face's
  `/api/datasets/{id}/leaderboard` answers for many benchmarks; every record is a vendor
  self-report scraped from a model card, with no version, harness, effort or date.
- **A working mirror can be silently stale.** `lmarena/arena-catalog` decodes cleanly and stopped
  syncing a generation ago. Check that a source knows about models you already carry.
- **An official file can be the wrong split.** ARC's public-eval JSON runs ~11 points above the
  verified board it would have been filed under.

To add a scripted source: write `scripts/fetchers/<id>.mjs`, list it in `scripts/fetchers/index.mjs`,
and declare `versioning`. `"pinned"` means the source freezes a version and any movement is an
integrity failure; `"live"` means it appends results and movement is new data; `"append-only"`
(LiveBench) means the version is frozen but the guest list is not — a cell that **appears** is new
data, a cell that **changed or vanished** is still an integrity failure. Getting that wrong either
turns the daily job permanently red or silently accepts a rewritten history.

Ask which one you are declaring by asking what the version freezes. LiveBench was `pinned` for two
months on the reasoning that a release freezes the question set — true, but a release does not
freeze *who has been run against it*. LiveBench added two models to release 2026-06-25 on
2026-08-04, seven weeks after publishing it, and the daily job stayed red until someone read the 46
cells and saw that every one of them said `appeared`.

## Adding a model

Model records are hand-authored because they also carry editorial content — inclusion,
display name, colour, tags, ordering — that has no source to generate from. Every *number*
on them is audited instead: `npm run check:models` fails when a catalog value contradicts
`data/sources/`, and reports how many values have no archive row at all. It prints the count it
audited — 325 on 2026-08-12; read the command's own output rather than this line — including
context window and open-weights status, which nothing checked until one of them turned
out to be inventing an open model, and it fails on a `model_raw` that differs from an existing
alias only in casing, because alias resolution is case-sensitive and such a row is silently
dropped from ingest.

Two things that count are **not** in that number, and both have bitten:

- **A row it cannot resolve is skipped, not reported.** The audited count's denominator is rows
  whose model string has an alias. Qwen's Max tier spent weeks outside it — see
  `scripts/lib/product-tiers.mjs` and `GOTCHAS.md` 21.
- **Each field takes the first batch that supplies it, in file-name order.** An early
  hand-transcribed batch therefore holds the slot against every later scripted read, and the value
  it froze stays "backed" however far the source has moved. `supersededRows` is how a newer reading
  is allowed to win, per model and per field. The check now *reports* the slots in this position;
  it does not fail on them, because chasing a continuously re-measured latency is not the goal.

So: put the operating parameters in the archive first, then write the record. For a model
Artificial Analysis already covers, that is one command — and batch 14 keeps AA's **whole** list,
not just catalogued models, so a model you are about to add usually has its numbers archived
already. `npm run check:models` then tells you if what you typed disagrees with them.

`AA_API_KEY` is read from the environment and belongs in a GitHub secret, never in a file. It is
optional everywhere: without it the AA source skips itself and every other check still runs.

Field sources are fixed:

| Field | Source |
| --- | --- |
| intelligence, cost per task, speed, latency | Artificial Analysis — now scripted: `AA_API_KEY=… npm run fetch:sources aa` archives them with provenance before you write the record |
| price | official vendor page, else Artificial Analysis — **list price, never a promotion** |
| text / code Elo | LMArena, **scripted since 2026-08-06** (`npm run fetch:sources arena`, daily) and **derived, not typed.** `npm run ingest` reads it from the archive into `ARENA_ELO`; the catalog record carries no Elo at all |

**Arena Elo is not yours to type.** It moves with every vote, so a number written into a catalog
record is stale the next day and a daily refresh of it would put `check:models` in permanent
disagreement with the catalog — the same reason Artificial Analysis is kept out of the daily job.
`npm run ingest` derives it from the archive instead, using the same three-rung rule the audit uses
(the flagship's operating point, then the row published with no operating point, then anything).
Removing the hand-typed values changed exactly two numbers out of 29 models, and both were
corrections: Claude Opus 4.8's code Elo of 1539 had no archive row behind it and is now `N/A`,
and Gemini 3.1 Pro gained a code Elo of 1446 that had been sitting in the archive uncollected.

**A missing AA measurement no longer blocks a record.** `intelligence` is `number | null`, so a
model AA has not measured yet is catalogued with `N/A` in the general-capability lens and ranks
normally on every lens that does not read it. This was a hard block until 2026-08-06: the field
was non-nullable, so Qwen3.8 Max sat outside the catalog with 36 fillable cells — LiveBench,
Epoch's GPQA run, DeepSWE, ALE, GDPval-AA — because one third party had not published a composite
of its own. Note that AA is several surfaces: its GDPval-AA board carried this model while its
parameter index did not, so "AA has not measured it" needs to name which AA you mean. Missing evidence is `N/A` here for the same reason it is everywhere else. The rest of the
table still holds: do not substitute another index, and do not estimate one.

Price then comes from the maker rather than AA, and the maker's own store is where a new model
appears first. Qwen3.8 Max was priced on the QwenCloud marketplace card three days before either
list-price table carried it (batch 21). **Read the card for a model you already carry before
trusting it**: that page prints promotional prices too, labelled `50% off` with both figures, and
the check is to confirm the unlabelled figure matches the list price already archived.

LMArena's price column is not used as a price source — it states no tier or region, so it
cannot be reconciled with a vendor page that prices Standard, Batch and Priority differently.
It is **not** unreliable: batch 06 concluded it was, on the grounds that it disagreed with the
catalog on Claude Fable 5 and GPT-5.5. Batch 08 showed the catalog was the stale one. Prefer
official pages for precision, not because LMArena is wrong.

## Traps this project has already hit

- A cell can legitimately hold several rows (harness, effort, tools, context length). The
  table shows the primary and marks the rest `+n`. Do not deduplicate them away.
- Two benchmark versions in one cell means one model's version gets compared against
  another's. `check:data` fails on it; give the second version its own benchmark id.
- Vendor numbers run high on **system** benchmarks (up to +8 points on Terminal-Bench) but
  match on **model exams**. Do not "fix" a benchmark-native number toward a vendor one.
- Sources publish a tool list where a boolean belongs, and a model string that is not a model
  at all (`Multiple`, `Best per task`). Both are handled; see `data/model-aliases.json`.
- When a catalog number and a source disagree, check which one has a source before assuming
  the source is wrong. Batch 08 corrected 43 catalog values this way, including two prices
  that had been used as evidence *against* a source.
- Vendors price in tiers and regions. Archive the tier the catalog quotes and record the
  others in the batch meta, so a later reader does not "correct" Standard to Batch.
- A rule enforced in a *report* is not enforced on the *site*. "Served upstream, not in this
  catalog" is computed twice — `scripts/report-gaps.mjs` from the archive, `app/api/live-models`
  from the provider at runtime — and the tier/variant filter had been written twice and applied in
  neither of the reader's copies. The daily issue read clean while quarkspace.top listed five
  `(batch)` / `(Fast)` tiers, which were also spending five of the list's eight slots and hiding
  three real models. Both now import `app/upstream-variants.ts`. Ask *who prints this sentence*, and
  how many of them there are.
- Any `slice(0, N)` that a reader sees must report what it cut. A silent truncation reads as
  "that is all of them".
- **One published model string can mean two different models, and which one depends on the
  source.** DeepSeek shipped V4 Flash as a preview and then as the post-trained 0731 release,
  whose scores are far higher. LiveBench, Epoch and LMArena publish both and print `-0731` for the
  official one; Artificial Analysis never renamed its slug, so there the bare string *is* 0731.
  A single global alias therefore reported the preview's LiveBench numbers — 49.25 where the
  official model scores 100 — under the 0731 record, and nothing failed: `check:data` only
  *reports* a cross-source disagreement, and a mis-attribution inside one model looks identical to
  a benchmark being hard. Aliases may carry `"file"` to scope them to one batch; scoping is the
  last resort, and an unattributable string stays unmapped. Effort cannot substitute for it — on
  LiveBench both releases carry no effort at all.
- **A substring lookup will find the wrong model, and a wrong price looks exactly like a right
  one.** `list.find(id => id.includes("gpt-5.6"))` returned `openai/gpt-5.6-luna-pro`, so the
  GPT-5.6 Sol price card rendered $0.10/$0.60 instead of $5/$30 — and six other lookups landed on
  a `-fast`, `-pro` or `-lite` variant. Provider ids in `PROVIDER_LOOKUPS` are exact, and the live
  feed compares against the archived price rather than overwriting it. A number that arrives at
  runtime has no archive row behind it, so it can never be a catalog number.

## Safe change sequence

1. Add evidence to `data/sources/` before touching anything in `app/`.
2. Record the editorial call in `data/model-aliases.json` with its reason.
3. `npm run ingest` and read the skip report, or `npm run report:gaps` for the same thing ranked
   by what it would unlock — both tell you what the catalog is missing.
4. Run every required check.
5. Review desktop and mobile on the EdgeOne preview URL. CI runs `npm run check:mobile` on both
