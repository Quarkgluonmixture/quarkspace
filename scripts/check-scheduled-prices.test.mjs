// A scheduled price term is a guard that fires on a date. Running it today proves only that it is
// quiet today, which is also what a term that never fires looks like — so both sides of every
// effective date are asserted here by re-running the real contract with `--as-of`.
//
//   node --test scripts/check-scheduled-prices.test.mjs
//
// Why a test file rather than a `--self-test` flag like the other guards: this one has to observe
// the contract's EXIT CODE, and that is exactly what a pipeline hides. The first run of this
// assertion reported green on both sides because `$?` after `node … | tail -5` is tail's status,
// not node's — the same trap `upstream.yml` calls load-bearing pipefail. Reading the status from a
// child process leaves nothing to get wrong.
