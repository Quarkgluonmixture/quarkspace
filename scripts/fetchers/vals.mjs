// Vals AI, read from the props its own leaderboard components are rendered with.
//
// §9 recorded Vals as publishing nothing machine-readable, twice. That verdict was a claim about
// the search, and this is the eighth of them to be overturned. Two things had hidden it:
//
//   /benchmarks is an INDEX, not a board. It has no table and no scores, which is what both
//     earlier passes measured. Every actual leaderboard is at /benchmarks/<slug>.
//   Those pages are Astro, and Astro server-renders a component's props into a `props="…"`
//     attribute on <astro-island>. So the whole board is in the HTML — 1.16MB of it for
//     CorpFin v2 — but it is HTML-escaped JSON in an attribute, not a <table>, so every check
//     for `<tr>`, `<table>`, `fetch(` or an `/api/` path answers no. There is nothing to find in
//     the JavaScript chunks because the data never travels separately from the page.
//
// One board now breaks that second sentence, and it is why the loop below skips instead of
// throwing when a board with no catalog column has no island: `rsi_index` (first seen
// 2026-08-14) is a client-only React component whose whole dataset — 3 models, 5 research
// tasks, `score` 0-1, no `overall` — is bundled inside its JS chunk, `props="{}"`. Boards that
// map to a catalog column still hard-fail on a missing island, because that is a restyle of a
// board this project publishes.
//
// What licensed replacing the transcription: batch 05 hand-read six CorpFin v2 rows —
// 73.19 / 71.83 / 71.56 / 71.29 / 68.57 / 68.53 — and this file's `overall` task gives
// 73.194 / 71.834 / 71.562 / 71.29 / 68.57 / 68.532 for the same six models. Six of six, so
// `overall` is the view the board shows by default and the one that was transcribed.
//
// The other task views are NOT other readings of that number. CorpFin's `exact_pages`,
// `max_fitting_context` and `shared_max_context` are three different context conditions of the
// same questions, and LegalBench's `issue_tasks` / `rule_tasks` are subsets. Ingesting them
// beside `overall` would put one model's condition against another's in one column, which rule 4
// forbids — so only `overall` is read, except where batch 05 deliberately recorded a named
// sub-task as its own column (CyberBench's poc/patch, Web Search's finance/legal), which is
// carried below as an explicit map rather than as a rule.

// CorpFin v2. On somebody else's it is not — Vals calls its GPQA Diamond board `1` and its
// SWE-bench board `1`, which say nothing about which GPQA or which SWE-bench split those are, and
// writing them into the shared column put `v2.1` beside the `2.1` already there and failed
// check:data for mixing versions in one cell. So a shared column gets null and inherits the
// column's own version, which is what batch 05 recorded for the same five boards.
//
// A bare `1` is dropped for the same reason one step further: it does not mean "version 1 of the
// question set", it means Vals has never revised this board. Writing it collides with the label
// the column already declares — `vals-ioi` and `vals-skillsbench` declare `2026`,

// `ingest` drops a row that has neither a published version nor a `versionFallbacks` entry, and it
// says so in its skip report. `terminal` has no fallback, so nulling it silently deleted all 50 of
// Vals' Terminal-Bench rows from the store while every contract stayed green — the archive had
