// Epoch AI's benchmark export — one CC BY ZIP holding 76 CSVs, at a fixed URL.
//
// Two kinds of file are in there and the difference decides how each row is classed:
//
//   Epoch's own evaluations — frontiermath, frontiermath_tier_4, gpqa_diamond. Epoch ran these.
//     The rows carry the reasoning effort inside the model string, a standard error, the run
//     timestamp, and a link to the raw inspect log. That is richer provenance than the catalog
//     previously held for these cells.
//
//   *_external.csv — Epoch transcribing somebody else's board, with a Source Link per row.
//     Second-hand by definition, so these are only carried where no first-hand path exists
//     (§4 source policy), and always as `independent` — never `benchmark`. Source precedence
//     then does the rest: if a native fetcher is ever written for one of these boards, its rows
//     outrank these automatically and these become listed variants.
//
// Four external files were examined and rejected, which is worth not rediscovering:
//   ale_bench_external.csv   ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic rating, ~2176) is a different
//                            benchmark from Agents' Last Exam. Same three letters, nothing else.
//   gdpval_external.csv      publishes a win rate; the catalog's `gdpval` is GDPval-AA, scored
//                            in Elo by Artificial Analysis. Different metric, different board.
//   hle_external.csv         states no tool setting anywhere, and HLE with and without tools are
//                            separate benchmarks here. Unusable without guessing.
//   terminalbench/deepswe    first-hand fetchers exist; see scripts/fetchers/.

// makes it collide with rows from sources that simply did not print an effort — which is how

// frontiermath.csv and frontiermath_tier_4.csv are DELIBERATELY NOT READ, and this is the reason,
// so nobody adds them back on the reasonable-looking grounds that Epoch publishes them.
//
// They are a **retired question set**, not a second reading of the current one. This file used to
// say the divergence was unexplained — the export tops out at 52.40 across all 101 Tiers 1-3 rows
// while the page's leader is 89, about 1.7x, GPT-5.5 xhigh 85.3 on the page against 51.70 in the
// CSV — and that note was correct about the numbers and wrong about the cause. Epoch's
// benchmarks.csv settles it by naming what each run was against: the ZIP's 101 rows are
// `FrontierMath-2025-02-28-Private` and its 72 tier-4 rows are
// `FrontierMath-Tier-4-2025-07-01-Private`, whereas the boards the site renders are
// `FrontierMath-Tiers-1-3-v2-Private` (42 rows) and `FrontierMath-Tier-4-v2-Private` (44). Two
// versions of a benchmark, which this project may never merge into one cell.
//
// So the divergence was never inside the export. Reading these files anyway would put a retired
// version's score in a column of current ones, which is the same failure as reading a public split
// into a verified board's column.
//
// The current boards are collected by scripts/fetchers/epoch-frontiermath.mjs, from
// /data/benchmarks.csv — the file the board page itself fetches. Should a v3 ship, the ZIP will
// most likely keep publishing v2 under these two filenames, and that is exactly why they are read
// by task name over there rather than by filename here.
