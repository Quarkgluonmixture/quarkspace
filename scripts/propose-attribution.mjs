// This is the step that used to be a person, and it is the most dangerous step in the project: a
// wrong alias reports one model's score under another's name and NOTHING catches it. So the
// question this file answers is not "which model is this probably" — it is "is there evidence that
// settles it". When there is not, it refuses, and refusing costs nothing: the row stays in the
// archive and attaches itself the day an alias exists.
//
// Two tiers, measured against the 247 decisions a human had already made before this existed:
//
//   tier 1  the string, after stripping a CLOSED list of effort tokens, is exactly a catalog
//           family — 144 of 240 reproduced, 0 contradicted.
//   tier 2  the string's scores corroborate a family on at least two like-for-like cells, or one
//           agreeing to within 0.2% — +13, 0 contradicted.
//
// Everything else escalates. That is 35% of the historical set and it is the correct outcome:
// those are strings like `qwen-qwen3-7-max`, where a board doubles a maker prefix for one family
// and not the next, and no rule short of reading the page settles it.
//
// Four refusals are deterministic and exist because the measurement found them:
//
//   - a bare string whose SAME SOURCE also publishes a suffixed sibling. That source is saying
//     they are two models — the reasoning of the one-source-one-cell gate. This is the DeepSeek
//     V4 Flash case, where `deepseek-v4-flash` is the preview on three boards and the 0731
//     release on a fourth, and one global alias put a 49.25 where the real model scores 100.
//   - a version number that does not appear in the string. Without it, "gpt" alone made GPT-5.5 a
//     candidate for GPT-5.6 Sol: one generation splits into Sol, Terra and Luna, and a successor
//     scoring near its predecessor is the normal case, not evidence.
//   - a string published only inside another maker's release table. Those are competitor columns:
//     a maker publishing a rival's score states no harness, effort or date.
//   - a string whose every row is superseded by a later batch.
//   - a bare string that has a DATED sibling anywhere in the archive and does not positively
//     agree with it. See `datedSiblingDisagrees` for why this is a fifth refusal rather than a
//     widening of the first.
//
// The `intelligence`-style judgement calls — is this worth cataloguing, what colour, what tags —
// are not here. This file only answers "which model is this string".

// The fifth refusal: one string whose meaning changed on a date.
//
// The first refusal compares strings inside ONE file, because a board printing two names is that
// board saying they are two models. It cannot see the shape that actually costs money here: a
// source that never renames its slug. Artificial Analysis kept `deepseek-v4-flash` across a
// re-train, so within AA's file there is no sibling to notice, while LiveBench, Epoch and LMArena
// print `-0731` in a different file. One global alias then reported a preview's 49.25 as the
// release's 100, and nothing failed. `deepseek-v4-pro` is set up to repeat it: the catalog record
// holds the April preview's cells and five bare strings resolve to it with `effort: "*"`, while
// the GA `-0813` slug went live 2026-08-12.
//
// So the sibling search is widened across files, and narrowed to DATED suffixes only. A date is
// the one suffix that never means an operating point: `pro`, `lite` and `mini` are model
// distinctions the tiers already handle, and a version like `Muse Spark 1.1` is a different model
// with its own record. Four digits is the shortest real date (MMDD) and the longest version
// fragment is two, which is what separates `-0813` from `1.1` without a list to maintain.
//
// A dated sibling alone does not refuse, because a maker may date a snapshot of the SAME model:
// a human mapped `qwen3.7-max-20260517` onto `qwen3.7-max` for exactly that reason. What refuses
// is the absence of positive agreement. If the two strings agree on a like-for-like cell they are
// one model and the date is a snapshot; if they conflict they are two; and if they share no cell
// at all there is no evidence either way, which is the case GOTCHAS 24 warns about — the GA score
// lands in a cell the preview never filled, so no disagreement gate can fire. Refusing on absent
// evidence is the same reasoning as the rest of this file: a refusal costs a delay, a wrong alias
// costs a wrong number nobody can see.
// A dated sibling keeps its date even after the effort is stripped, but the date can sit either
// side of the effort token: `qwen3.7-max-20260517` (tier, then date) and
// `deepseek-v4-pro-high-20260813` (date after the effort). Stripping the effort alone left a
// `max0813` residue that failed the pure-date test, so a GA slug like `qwen3.7-max-0813` was
// invisible to the fifth refusal — measured 2026-09-22, when a batch-50 alias refusal rotated
// the self-test's runtime-chosen subject onto "Qwen3.7-Max" and the rule was silent on it.

// So the scenario is simulated instead: the GA string is injected with the vendor's own published
// GA numbers on cells the preview never filled — DeepSWE 62.7 against the preview's 12.8, Terminal
// 2.1 87.9 against 72.1 — which is the exact shape GOTCHAS 24 predicts, a score landing where no

// Both directions, because a refusal that never lifts is not a rule, it is an outage. The subject
// is chosen at runtime rather than hard-coded: the first string the gate maps cleanly today. That
// keeps the test measuring the fifth refusal instead of accumulating a second reason to fail as
// the archive changes underneath it.

// Worth recording, because it changed what this rule is for: `deepseek-v4-pro` was the intended
