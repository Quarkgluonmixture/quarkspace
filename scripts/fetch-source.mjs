//   pinned source, a cell moved     integrity failure. The archive no longer matches its source
//                                   under a version that is supposed to be frozen. Exit 1.
//   append-only source, a cell       integrity failure, same as pinned. The frozen part of an
//   changed or vanished              append-only source is the numbers it already published.
//   append-only source, a cell       new data. The question set is frozen, but the board keeps
//   appeared                         running new models against it, so a row that did not exist
//                                   before contradicts nothing. Exit 0, batch rewritten.
//   live source, a cell moved       new data. DataCurve appends DeepSWE runs and the pass rates
//                                   move; that is the board working. Exit 0, and the scheduled job
//                                   opens a pull request with the rewritten batch.
//
// Writing is idempotent on purpose. When the fetched rows equal the archived rows nothing is
// touched — not even the sidecar's retrievedDate — so a refresh of an unchanged source
// produces no diff and therefore no pull request.

// An append-only board freezes its question set, not the list of models run against it — so a row
// that APPEARS contradicts nothing, while a row that CHANGED or VANISHED is the archive being
// contradicted, and that is a person's call. That rule is right and it has one gap: a source can
// re-run a model under a different published string, which lands as a vanish plus an appearance and
// leaves the check red every single day until somebody edits the archive.
//
// Measured 2026-08-15: LiveBench replaced 23 `grok-4.6-xhigh` rows (effort in the string) with 23
// `grok-4.6` rows (no effort stated) under the same frozen 2026-06-25 release, and 20 of the 23
// scores differ. Accepting that silently would delete the only record anybody has of the xhigh run;
// refusing it leaves a daily WeChat push that trains its reader to ignore the channel. Both are bad
// in the way this repository keeps saying is the expensive direction — a refusal nobody can audit,
// or an alarm nobody reads.
//
// So this is the third escape hatch, and deliberately the same shape as the two in the alias config
// (`acknowledgedDisagreements`, `mergedInOneSource`): it takes effect only with a written reason.
// It silences a VANISH and never a CHANGE — a moved number is still an integrity failure — and the
// rows it covers are kept in the archive when the batch is rewritten, which is the whole point.

// The fourth hatch, added 2026-09-04, and the narrowest of them.
//
// The rule above says a moved number is an integrity failure no written reason can excuse, and
// that stays true as a default: a board that silently corrects a published score is the exact
// thing this check exists to catch. But "no reason can excuse it" left the owner with only two
// moves once it actually happened — leave the daily job permanently red, or downgrade the whole
// source to `versioning: "live"` and lose the check on its other 24 columns. Both are worse than
// the thing they answer.
//
// So: an acknowledgement that pins BOTH values. It excuses one restatement of one cell — this
// archived value becoming that upstream value — and nothing else. If the same cell moves again to
// a third value, `to` stops matching and the check fails exactly as it did before. That is the
// property `versioning: "live"` cannot give: it excuses this change without excusing the next one.
//
// It differs from `withdrawnRows` in what happens to the row. A withdrawn row is KEPT (upstream
// stopped publishing it and the archive is the only remaining record). A restated row is REPLACED
// — the point of accepting a restatement is that upstream's new value is the one to hold, so the
